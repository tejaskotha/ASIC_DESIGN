 ### Description
   In this lab we compile a simple C program using GCC and RISCV compliers.
 ### Tasks
1.  Writing a simple C program to calculate sum of n numbers and execute the program using GCC.
2.  Execute the same C program using RISCV compiler and compare the results.
## Procedure
 ### Task-1
1. Create a new file(sum1ton.c) in home directory.(Run the command 'cd' before creating the file to make sure you are in home directory).
2. We use leafpad as texteditor to write the code.
   ### Code
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   int main(){
     int i,sum=0,n=100;
     for(i=1;i<=n;i++){
       sum+=i;
     }
     printf("Sum of numbers from 1 to %d is %d\n",n,sum);
     return 0;
   }
   ```
   ### To compile the code using GCC
   ```
   gcc sum1ton.c
   ```

   ### To Run the code
   ```
   ./a.out
   ```
   ### Output

### Task-2 : Compliling and verifying the same C code using RISC-V compiler
  1. Compile the code using RISV using the below command
     ```
     riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
     ```
  2. To run the code
     ```
     riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
     ```
  3. Output
     ![Ouput of RISCV](images/riscv_op.jpg)
  ### Explanation of the Output:
  - 0000000000010184 is the address where the main function starts.
  - To known the number of instructions it takes to execute we subtract 0000000000010184(which is the next function) from 00000000000101c0 and divide it by 4(Since each instruction takes 4 bytes).
  - In this case it take 15 instructions.
  - We can reduce the number of instructions it takes by compiling the code using the below command.
     ```
     riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
     ```
     ![Output of riscv](images/riscvfast_op.jpg)
    - Run the code using the same code as above.
    - In the above case it is taking only 12 instructions to execute.

  ### Description
  Comparing the GCC compiled output with RISCV compiled output
  ### Procedure
  1. Compile the code using the below command.
     ```
     riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
     ```
  2. Run the code
     ```
     spike pk sum1ton.o
     ```
  3. Output
     ![Output of riscv](images/3.png)
  ### Debugging the Code
  - We debug the code using the below command
    ```
    spike -d pk sum1ton.o
    ```
  - First run the RISCV code(`riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less`).We can get the location of main function from where we can debug the code line by line.
    #### Output
    ![Output](images/4.png)
    
  - Use the below command to take pc to the main function .(100b0 is the starting point of the main function).
    ```
    until pc 0 100b0
    ```
  - We can know the initial value of a2 before executing the instruction and obsereve the change in the value of a2 after executing the instruction.
  - To know the value of a2 use the below command.Press enter the run the following instructions.
     ```
     reg 0 a2
     ```
     ![Output](images/5.png)
  - lui - Load Upper immediate.
  - We can observe the value of a2 is changed.
  - Similarily, we can also observe the working of the other RISCV instruction i.e addi
  - To observe the working of addi, first move the pc to 100b8(which means program is executed till the instruction 100b8).Then observe the change in the value of sp(-16 in decimal is 10 in hexadecimal).We can observe the value of sp is decresed by 10.
